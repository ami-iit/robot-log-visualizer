`GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH`, `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH` Please remember to add your model folder to one of these
environment variables.
For instance, if you have a model in the folder `~/my-models` you can add it to the `GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` with the
following command
```console
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}:~/my-models
 ```
Where `~/my-models` is the path to your models folder that is structured as follows
```console
tree ~/my-models
~/my-models
├── model1
│   ├── model.config
│   └── model.urdf
└── model2
    ├── model.config
    └── model.urdf
```
And the name of the robot stored in the `mat` file is `model1` or `model2`.
